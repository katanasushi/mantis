# Mantis

Ethereum-like Blockchain Scala client built by IOHK's for Ethereum Classic (ETC) network

### Status - Not maintaineds

The lastest ETC hard-fork supported by the client is [Magneto hard-fork](https://ecips.ethereumclassic.org/ECIPs/ecip-1103)

You can check the latest build results of the current branch by clicking the status icon in the header of the Github file browser.

### Download the client

The latest release can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mantis/releases)

### Command line version

In the `bin` directory, you can find the generic launcher. To connect to a pre-configured network just pass the network name as a parameter.

Example:
  - `./bin/mantis-launcher etc` - for joining Ethereum Classic network

Possible networks: `etc`, `eth`, `mordor`, `testnet-internal`

### Command Line Interface

`cli` is a tool that can be used to:

 - generate a new private key
 ```
./bin/mantis cli generate-private-key
```
 - derive an address from private key
```
./bin/mantis cli derive-address 00b11c32957057651d56cd83085ef3b259319057e0e887bd0fdaee657e6f75d0
```
 - generate genesis allocs (using private keys and/or addresses)
```
`./bin/mantis cli generate-allocs --balance=42 --address=8b196738d90cf3d9fc299e0ec28e15ebdcbb0bdcb281d9d5084182c9c66d5d12 --key=00b11c32957057651d56cd83085ef3b259319057e0e887bd0fdaee657e6f75d1`
```
 - generate multiple key-pairs (following example generate 5 key-pairs)
 ```
./bin/mantis cli generate-key-pairs 5
```

- encrypt private key (default passphrase is empty string)
 ```
./bin/mantis cli encrypt-key --passphrase=pass 00b11c32957057651d56cd83085ef3b259319057e0e887bd0fdaee657e6f75d0
```

The command output uses the same format as the keystore so it could be used ex. to setup private faucet

ex.

  }
}
```

### Building the client

As an alternative to downloading the client, build the client from source.

#### With SBT

##### Prerequisites to build

- JDK 1.8 (download from [java.com](http://www.java.com))
- sbt ([download sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html))
- python 2.7.15 (download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/))

##### Build the client

In the root of the project:

```
git submodule update --recursive --init
sbt dist
```

This updates all submodules and creates a distribution zip in `~/target/universal/`.

Note: building in _dev_ mode allows faster and incremental compilation, for this:
   - set environment variable `MANTIS_DEV` to `true`, or
   - use the system property `-DmantisDev=true`

#### With Nix

In the root of the project:

##### Build the client

```
nix-build
```

##### On a Mac

This project uses Nix for CI, deployment and, optionally, local development.
Some of the dependencies are not available for Darwin (macOS) however. To work
with Nix on a Mac you can instead use Docker via the `nix-in-docker/run` script,
which will start a `nix-shell` with the same environment as CI.

##### Update sbt+nix dependencies

When updating project dependencies, the nix fixed-output-derivation
will need to be updated so that it includes the new dependency state.

To do so, please run:
```
./update-nix.sh
git add ./nix/overlay.nix
git commit -m "Update nix-sbt sha"
```

For this command to work you'll need the [Flakes](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes) feature enabled in your `nix` environment.

*NOTE:* This should only be necessary when updating dependencies
(For example, edits to build.sbt or project/plugins.sbt will likely need to be regenerated)

### Monitoring

#### Locally build & run monitoring client

A docker-compose setup using Prometheus and Grafana, and a preconfigured dashboard, is available.
As a precondition you need to have docker and sbt installed.
Before running the script, you need to enable metrics by editing the file `metrics.conf` and setting `mantis.metrics.enabled=true`

To build the monitoring, run the following script at `./docker/mantis/build.sh`.
This script builds a docker image of mantis using the local sources and starts the docker-compose.

Grafana will be available at http://localhost:3000 (using user and password: admin and admin) with a dashboard called `Mantis`.


### TLS setup

Both the JSON RPC (on the node and faucet) can be additionally protected using TLS.
The development environment it already properly configured with a development certificate.

#### Generating a new certificate

If a new certificate is required, create a new keystore with a certificate by running `./tls/gen-cert.sh`

#### Configuring the node

1. Configure the certificate and password file to be used at `mantis.network.rpc.http.certificate` key on the `application.conf` file:

    keystore-path: path to the keystore storing the certificates (if generated through our script they are by default located in "./tls/mantisCA.p12")

    keystore-type: type of certificate keystore being used (if generated through our script use "pkcs12")

    password-file: path to the file with the password used for accessing the certificate keystore (if generated through our script they are by default located in "./tls/password")
2. Enable TLS in specific config:
    - For JSON RPC: `mantis.network.rpc.http.mode=https`

#### Configuring the faucet

1. Configure the certificate and password file to be used at `mantis.network.rpc.http.certificate` key on the `faucet.conf` file:

   keystore-path: path to the keystore storing the certificates (if generated through our script they are by default located in "./tls/mantisCA.p12")

   keystore-type: type of certificate keystore being used (if generated through our script use "pkcs12")

   password-file: path to the file with the password used for accessing the certificate keystore (if generated through our script they are by default located in "./tls/password")
2. Enable TLS in specific config:
   - For JSON RPC: `mantis.network.rpc.http.mode=https`
3. Configure the certificate used from RpcClient to connect with the node. Necessary if the node uses http secure.
   This certificate and password file to be used at `faucet.rpc-client.certificate` key on the `faucet.conf` file:

   keystore-path: path to the keystore storing the certificates
   keystore-type: type of certificate keystore being used (if generated through our script use "pkcs12")
   password-file: path to the file with the password used for accessing the certificate keystore

### Faucet setup and testing
1. First start a client node using the docker-compose, by running the script found at `./docker/mantis/build.sh`
Modify the script before running it by adding the `volumes` and `command` sections to mantis configuration:
```
mantis:
image: mantis:latest
ports:
- 8546:8546
- 13798:13798
- 9095:9095
networks:
- mantis-net
volumes:
- $HOME/.mantis:/home/demiourgos728/.mantis/
command: -Dconfig.file=./conf/sagano.conf
```

2. Create a wallet address. Run the following curl command, replacing `<password>` by a password of your choice:
```
curl --request POST \
  --url http://127.0.0.1:8546/ \
  --header 'Cache-Control: no-cache' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
	"jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "personal_newAccount",
  "params": ["<password>"],
  "id": 1
}'
```

You will receive a response like this:
```
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","result":"<address>","id":1}
```

3. Modify `src/universal/conf/faucet.conf` file, config your account address created in the previous step. with the password choosen by you:
```
wallet-address = "<address>"
wallet-password = "<password>"
```

4. Now check the `keystore` folder in `~/.mantis/testnet-internal-nomad/keystore`.
Inside you will find a key generate with the curl request sent in step `2.`. Copy that file to `~/.mantis-faucet/keystore/`:
```
cp UTC--<date>--<key> ~/.mantis-faucet/keystore/
```

5. Start the faucet in command line:
```
sbt -Dconfig.file=src/universal/conf/faucet.conf "run faucet"
```

6. Run the following curl command to send tokens from your faucet to a wallet address:
```
curl --request POST \
  --url http://127.0.0.1:8099/ \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
	"jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "faucet_sendFunds",
  "params": ["<address>"],
  "id": 1
}'
```

Happy transfer!

Note: In order for the transfer transaction be persisted, a faucet needs sufficient founds in its account and in this test
case a new faucet, without ETC tokens, is being created.
